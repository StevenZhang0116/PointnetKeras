# PointnetKeras

A simple and preliminary implementation of Point Cloud Classification with PointNet using ModelNet10 dataset on Keras. The ultimate accuracy is 86.1%, slightly lower than the 89.2% testing result published by [Qi et al., 2017](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.00593). Using a larger training dataset, like ModelNet40 or ShapeNet, with more training epochs might be helpful to improve the performance.
